Originally started for the Drunken Coders 2007 christmas competition, this game is a puzzle game unlike any others. The basic principles are similar to that of Hexic and Columns, but the unique attribute of the game is the ability to change the gameplay in the middle of a turn. By doing this, the user can either set their action to "Balanced" mode, which rotates the gems around a center gem, and creates combos that way. Or the user can use the "Chaotic" mode, which only gives the user one block to destroy at a time. Chaotic mode is harder to earn points with, however the payout is generally much higher and can cause much bigger gems. Also, in Chaotic mode, the user can build up a power bar to explode a large region of gems. In Balanced mode, the user can attempt to balance a section of gems by changing them to the color in the middle of the cursor.

All of this is totally free-hand in the works game design. All of it is subject to change, and I can't promise I will release this on anything but a Nintendo DS homebrew build!
